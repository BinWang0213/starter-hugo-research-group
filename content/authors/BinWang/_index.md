# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests include High performance computing, Digital rock physics and Particle laden flow.

# Long bio as a group leader
bio_feature: Dr. Wang's research focuses on understanding the multiphase particle-laden flow in fractured porous media using advanced computational and experimental tools. The research objective is to develop engineered particle-based fluid technology to characterize the energy reservoirs and improve the recovery of existing and unconventional resources.

interests:
  - Digital rock imaging and modeling
  - High-performance computing and simualtion
  - Flow and transport in fractured unconventional reservoirs
  - Nanofluids/P transport in unconventional reservoirs
  - Proppant transport in complex fracture networks
