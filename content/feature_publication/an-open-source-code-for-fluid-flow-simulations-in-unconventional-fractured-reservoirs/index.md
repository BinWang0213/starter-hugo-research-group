title: An Open-Source Code for Fluid Flow Simulations in Unconventional
  Fractured Reservoirs
abstract: In this article, an open-source code for the simulation of ﬂuid ﬂow,
  including adsorption, transport, and indirect hydromechanical coupling in
  unconventional fractured reservoirs is described. The code leverages
  cutting-edge numerical modeling capabilities like automatic differentiation,
  stochastic fracture modeling, multicontinuum modeling, and discrete fracture
  models. In the ﬂuid mass balance equation, speciﬁc physical mechanisms, unique
  to organic-rich source rocks, are included, like an adsorption isotherm, a
  dynamic permeability-correction function, and an Embedded Discrete Fracture
  Model (EDFM) with fracture-to-well connectivity. The code is validated against
  an industrial simulator and applied for a study of the performance of the
  Barnett shale reservoir, where adsorption, gas slippage, diffusion, indirect
  hydromechanical coupling, and propped fractures are considered. It is the ﬁrst
  open-source code available to facilitate the modeling and production
  optimization of fractured shale-gas reservoirs. The modular design also
  facilitates rapid prototyping and demonstration of new models. This article
  also contains a quantitative analysis of the accuracy and limitations of EDFM
  for gas production simulation in unconventional fractured reservoirs.
