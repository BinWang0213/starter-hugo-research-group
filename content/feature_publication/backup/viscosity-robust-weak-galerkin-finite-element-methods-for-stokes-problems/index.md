title: Viscosity robust weak Galerkin finite element methods for Stokes problems
abstract: In this paper, we develop a viscosity robust weak Galerkin ﬁnite
  element scheme for Stokes equations. The major idea for achieving pressure
  independent energy-error estimate is to use a divergence preserving velocity
  reconstruction operator in the discretization of the right hand side body
  force. The optimal convergence results for velocity and pressure have been
  established in this paper. Finally, numerical examples are presented for
  validating the theoretical conclusions.
