abstract: Modeling fluid flow in three-dimensional (3D) Discrete Fracture
  Networks (DFNs) is of relevance in many engineering applications, such as
  shale oil/gas production, geothermal energy extraction, nuclear waste disposal
  and CO2 sequestration. A new Boundary Element Method (BEM) technique with
  discontinuous quadratic elements, in conjunction with a parallel Domain
  Decomposition Method (DDM), is presented for the simulation of the
  steady-state fluid flow in DFNs, consisting of stochastically generated 3D
  planar fractures, arbitrarily oriented, and having differing hydraulic
  properties. Numerical examples characterized by DFNs of increasing complexity
  are proposed to show the accuracy and the efficiency of the presented
  technique, that provides good approximations of the fluid flow around domain
  interfaces, where the solution usually displays sharp gradients, like around
  intersections between traces (the segments originated by the intersection
  between two fractures), intersections between traces and fracture boundaries,
  or intersections between fractures and wellbores. The conjunction with a DDM
  approach is a promising strategy to speed up the computations, by also
  exploiting the advantages of parallel computing techniques. The technique is
  implemented in the code PyDFN3D, available at
  https://github.com/BinWang0213/PyDFN3D.
