title: Three-Dimensional Projection-Based Embedded Discrete-Fracture Model for
  Compositional Simulation of Fractured Reservoirs
abstract: Most unconventional oil and gas reservoirs are known to have several
  natural fractures in different orientations, which are consistent with the
  prevailing stresses when they were created. The accurate and efﬁcient modeling
  of natural and hydraulic fractures presents a signiﬁcant computational
  challenge. In this work, we show the limitations of the embedded
  discrete-fracture model (EDFM) and present the ﬁrst 3D projection-based EDFM
  (pEDFM) algorithm and compositional simulation studies with realistic fracture
  networks in a fully 3D space.
