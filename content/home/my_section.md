Dr. Wang's research focuses on understanding the multiphase particle-laden flow in fractured porous media using advanced computational and experimental tools. The research objective is to develop engineered particle-based fluid technology to characterize the energy reservoirs, design the engineering practices and improve the recovery of existing and unconventional resources. Currently, my research topics include:
