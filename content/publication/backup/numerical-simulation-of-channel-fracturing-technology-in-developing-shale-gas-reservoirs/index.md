title: Numerical simulation of channel fracturing technology in developing shale
  gas reservoirs
abstract: HiWay flow channel fracturing, as a paradigm shift in the conventional
  hydraulic fracturing, was introduced by Schlumberger in 2010. The improvement
  of the new technology compared to conventional fracturing methods is presented
  by the scattered multi-layer proppants which concentrate loose proppants into
  fibered pillars in order to provide broader flow pathways in fractures.
  Although numerous experimental and theoretical research have been conducted in
  the last decade, limitations still exist. In this study, we investigate the
  performance of the technique in improving the shale gas productivity via
  integrating channel fracture models into the open-source framework, MATLAB
  Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST). A new mathematical model is derived to
  determine the permeability and conductivity of channel fracturing by the shape
  changes of pillars in fractures. Verification and validation cases are
  conducted via comparing with a reference model and oilfield data,
  respectively. More computational cases are studied to demonstrate factors
  affecting the performance of channel fracturing, including natural fractures
  and the concentration of proppants. The simulation result reveals that the
  channeling fracturing benefits more from the natural fractures compared to the
  conventional fracturing technique, although the gas production is actually
  enhanced for both of the techniques. The proppant concentration is also an
  important parameter. A lower concentration scheme presents a high initial
  production rate because of the broader channels in fractures. While, a higher
  concentration scheme will enhance the support of the fracture aperture and
  benefit the long-term shale gas production. In the field case study, the
  simulation results are compared with shale gas production data from the well
  Heim 2H in Hawkville field. The simulated result matches the field data
  successfully in the stabilized period when the gas production is not affected
  by the screen out and flowback.
