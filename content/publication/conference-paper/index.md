title: Automatic Fault Segmentation Using Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks
abstract: This study presents a novel neural network model to explore its
  application in automatically interpreting subsurface faults from seismic
  images. A Wavelet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that incorporates
  discrete wavelet decomposition is presented, and its capability in segmenting
  subsurface faults is analyzed.
