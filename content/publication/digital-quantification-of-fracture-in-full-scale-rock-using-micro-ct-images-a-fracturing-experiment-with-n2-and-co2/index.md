title: "Digital quantification of fracture in full-scale rock using micro-CT
  images: A fracturing experiment with N2 and CO2"
abstract: How to effectively and cleanly exploit unconventional resources is
  currently being widely concerned. Due to the unavoidable limitations of
  water-based fracturing, CO2 and N2 etc., are regarded as alternative fluids
  for some specific reservoirs such as the arid area or high clay swelling
  formation. To investigate the characteristics of fracture induced by
  nonaqueous fluid in unconventional tight formation, fracturing experiments on
  tight sandstone using different fluid of water, N2, liquid CO2(L-CO2) and
  supercritical CO2(SC-CO2) were conducted. A novel fracture analysis approach
  based on CT scanning is also proposed to quantitatively analyze the
  micromorphology of fractures including fracture network pattern, fractal
  dimension (FD), aperture, area ratio (AR) and fracture volume etc. Results
  show that water and N2 can only induce a relatively simple fracture pattern.
  Whereas, fractures induced by CO2-based fluid have more complex fracture
  geometry with many fracture branches and various propagation orientations.
  Quantitative analysis based on image processing and fracture reconstruction
  algorithm indicates that the CO2-based fluid has up to 4.4 times larger
  fracture-induced capacity and can create fracture with up to 2.6 times higher
  complexity and 23.4% higher roughness than that generated by water-based
  fracturing. Comparing to SC-CO2, L-CO2 and water, N2 has the least
  fracture-induced capacity (83% of water) and produces more smooth and uniform
  fractures. On the other hand, the distributions of deviation angle suggest
  that fracture propagation is not only influenced by stress state, but also
  significantly affected by the original bedding plane. This experimental study
  proposes a precise and effective approach for fracture characteristic
  quantification, which can be further implemented into fracture simulation
  model. It also provides theoretical reference and guidance for field operation
  of waterless fracturing in development of unconventional oil and gas.
