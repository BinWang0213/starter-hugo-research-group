title: "Full-Sample X-ray Microcomputed Tomography Analysis of Supercritical CO2
  Fracturing in Tight Sandstone: Effect of Stress on Fracture Dynamics"
abstract: The commercial production from tight oil and gas reservoirs has been
  facilitated by the multistage hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells. This
  process typically requires the pumping of large amounts of slick water into
  the subsurface, and this could be challenging in areas with a limited supply
  of water. Despite the commercial success of hydraulic fracturing with water,
  it still faces the problem of clay swelling and potential contamination of
  underground water. This has led to research studies and ﬁeld applications of
  liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) fracturing in unconventional
  oil and gas resources. Considering that the propagation and characteristics of
  these man-made fractures are controlled by the fracturing ﬂuid and mechanical
  state of the reservoir, we performed a series of fracturing experiments on
  tight sandstones using water and SC-CO2 at diﬀerent stress magnitudes. To
  explore the morphology of the fractures and quantify their attributes, we
  proposed a novel full-sample fracture analysis approach, which is based on
  microcomputed tomography (CT) imaging. The results of this study indicate that
  the breakdown pressure is a linear function of the minimum principal stress
  and tensile strength. We observe that the pattern and geometry of the
  fractures created from SC-CO2 fracturing is more complex than those of water
  fracturing under the same stress conditions. Our experimental results also
  indicate that smaller diﬀerential stresses lead to the creation of more
  fracture branches and that fracture propagation is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the
  presence of initial bedding planes. Furthermore, our quantiﬁcation of the
  fracture attributes (based on fracture extraction and digitization) indicates
  that SC-CO2 fracturing leads to the creation of more complex fractures with
  rougher surfaces than water fracturing. This experimental study proposes a new
  full-sample fracture quantiﬁcation approach, which can be implemented to
  analyze fracture attributes precisely and eﬀectively. The results from this
  work could provide insights and guidance for the ﬁeld application of SC-CO2
  fracturing in unconventional oil and gas resources.
