title: "Iterative coupling algorithms for large multidomain problems with the
  boundary element method: Iterative coupling algorithms for Boundary Element
  Method"
abstract: A new parallel Robin-Robin adaptive iterative coupling algorithm with
  dynamic relaxation parameters is proposed for the boundary element method
  (BEM), and relaxation parameters are derived for other existing iterative
  coupling algorithms. The performances of the new algorithm and of the modified
  existing algorithms are investigated in terms of convergence properties with
  respect to the number of subdomains, mesh density, interface mesh conformity,
  and BEM element types. Results show that the number of subdomains and the
  refinement level of the mesh are the two dominant factors affecting the
  performances of the considered algorithms. The proposed parallel Robin-Robin
  algorithm shows the best overall convergence behavior for the tested large
  problems, thanks to its effectiveness in handling complex boundary conditions
  and large number of subdomains, thus resulting to be very promising for
  efficient parallel BEM computing and large coupling problems.
