title: Lab Testing and Finite Element Method Simulation of Hole Deflector
  Performance for Radial Jet Drilling
abstract: Radial jet drilling (RJD) is an efficient approach for improving the
  productivity of wells in low permeability, marginal and coal-bed methane (CBM)
  reservoirs at a very low cost. It uses high-pressure water jet to drill
  lateral holes from a vertical wellbore. The length of the lateral holes is
  greatly influenced by the frictional resistance in the hole deflector.
  However, the hole deflector frictional resistance and structure design have
  not been well studied. This work fills that gap. Frictional resistances were
  measured in a full-scale experiment and calculated by numerical simulation.
  The structure of the hole deflector was parameterized and a geometric model
  was developed to design the hole deflector track. An empirical model was then
  established to predict the frictional resistance as a function of the hole
  deflector structure parameters and an optimization method for designing the
  hole deflector was proposed. Finally, four types of hole deflectors were
  optimized using this method. The results show good agreement between the
  numerical simulation and the experimental data. The model error is within
  11.6%. The bend radius R and exit angle β are the key factors affecting the
  performance of the hole deflector. The validation test was conducted for a
  case hole deflector (5½ in. casing). The measured frictional resistance was
  decreased from 31.44 N to 23.16 N by 26.34%. The results from this research
  could serve as a reference for the design of hole deflectors for radial jet
  drilling.
