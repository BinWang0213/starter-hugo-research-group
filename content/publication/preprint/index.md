title: An Embedded Grid-Free Approach for Near-Wellbore Streamline Simulation
abstract: "Reactive-transport phenomena, such as carbon dioxide sequestration
  and microbial enhanced oil recovery (EOR), have been of interest in
  streamline-based simulation (SLS). Tracing streamlines launched from a
  wellbore is important, especially for time-sensitive transport behaviors.
  However, discretized gridblocks are usually too large compared with the
  wellbore radius. Field-scale simulations with localgrid-reﬁnement (LGR) models
  often consume huge computational time. An embedded grid-free approach to
  integrate near-wellbore transport behaviors into streamline simulations is
  developed, comprising two stages of development: tracing streamlines in a
  wellblock (a gridblock containing wells) and coupling streamlines with
  neighboring grids. The velocity ﬁeld in a wellblock is produced using a
  gridless virtual-boundary-element method (VBEM), where streamlines are
  numerically traced with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method (Butcher
  2008). The local streamline system is then connected with the global
  streamline system, which is produced with the Pollock (1988) algorithm.
  Finally, the reactive-transport equation will be solved along these
  streamlines."
