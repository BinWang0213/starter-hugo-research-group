title: Streamline-based simulation of nanoparticle transport in field-scale
  heterogeneous subsurface systems
abstract: Nanoparticle (NP) transport is increasingly relevant to subsurface
  engineering applications such as aquifer characterization and enhanced oil
  recovery. An efficient field-scale simulation framework is critical for
  predicting NP performance and designing subsurface applications. In this work,
  for the first time, a streamline-based model is presented to simulate NP
  transport in field-scale subsurface systems with heterogeneous permeability.
  It considers a series of smart behaviors exhibited by engineered nanoparticles
  (NPs), including time-triggered encapsulation, retention, formation damage
  effects and variable nanofluid viscosity. The key methods employed by the
  algorithm are streamline-based simulation (SLS) and an operator-splitting (OS)
  technique for modeling NP transport. The model is implemented in an in-house
  streamline-based code, which is verified against analytical solutions,
  commercial simulator and academic codes. Simulations on a synthetic
  three-dimensional (3D) nanocapsule application engineering design case, are
  also performed to investigate the effect of fluid and NP properties on the
  displacement pattern of an existing subsurface fluid.
