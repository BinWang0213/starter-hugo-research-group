	abstract = {HiWay flow channel fracturing, as a paradigm shift in the conventional hydraulic fracturing, was introduced by Schlumberger in 2010. The improvement of the new technology compared to conventional fracturing methods is presented by the scattered multi-layer proppants which concentrate loose proppants into fibered pillars in order to provide broader flow pathways in fractures. Although numerous experimental and theoretical research have been conducted in the last decade, limitations still exist. In this study, we investigate the performance of the technique in improving the shale gas productivity via integrating channel fracture models into the open-source framework, MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST). A new mathematical model is derived to determine the permeability and conductivity of channel fracturing by the shape changes of pillars in fractures. Verification and validation cases are conducted via comparing with a reference model and oilfield data, respectively. More computational cases are studied to demonstrate factors affecting the performance of channel fracturing, including natural fractures and the concentration of proppants. The simulation result reveals that the channeling fracturing benefits more from the natural fractures compared to the conventional fracturing technique, although the gas production is actually enhanced for both of the techniques. The proppant concentration is also an important parameter. A lower concentration scheme presents a high initial production rate because of the broader channels in fractures. While, a higher concentration scheme will enhance the support of the fracture aperture and benefit the long-term shale gas production. In the field case study, the simulation results are compared with shale gas production data from the well Heim 2H in Hawkville field. The simulated result matches the field data successfully in the stabilized period when the gas production is not affected by the screen out and flowback.},

	abstract = {Understanding flow and transport behaviors in subsurface porous rock is extremely important for various applications such as oil/gas reservoirs, groundwater, geothermal energy explorations, and CO2 sequestration. However, the relevant calculation is never an easy task because of the large areal extend and high heterogeneity of subsurface system. Although streamline-based simulations are suitable for solving large, geologically complex, and heterogeneous systems, they still present difficulties while working with the finite element method. This paper introduces a new algorithm to trace streamlines based on the underlying flow field in unstructured triangular mesh systems. The new solution procedure only requires velocities on each element vertex but not on cell facets, and therefore it does not rely on conservative fluxes. The algorithm is based on coupled ODEs derived from shape functions as well as the transformation formula between the actual and master elements. The analytical solution describing the trajectory of a streamline segment in the master element is derived so that the time-offlight and exit coordinate (leaving the element) can be determined accurately and efficiently. Additionally, the presented algorithm allows the implementation of streamline-based methods in the programming framework, FEniCS, so as to extend the technique to other research areas.},

	abstract = {How to effectively and cleanly exploit unconventional resources is currently being widely concerned. Due to the unavoidable limitations of water-based fracturing, CO2 and N2 etc., are regarded as alternative fluids for some specific reservoirs such as the arid area or high clay swelling formation. To investigate the characteristics of fracture induced by nonaqueous fluid in unconventional tight formation, fracturing experiments on tight sandstone using different fluid of water, N2, liquid CO2(L-CO2) and supercritical CO2(SC-CO2) were conducted. A novel fracture analysis approach based on CT scanning is also proposed to quantitatively analyze the micromorphology of fractures including fracture network pattern, fractal dimension (FD), aperture, area ratio (AR) and fracture volume etc. Results show that water and N2 can only induce a relatively simple fracture pattern. Whereas, fractures induced by CO2-based fluid have more complex fracture geometry with many fracture branches and various propagation orientations. Quantitative analysis based on image processing and fracture reconstruction algorithm indicates that the CO2-based fluid has up to 4.4 times larger fracture-induced capacity and can create fracture with up to 2.6 times higher complexity and 23.4\% higher roughness than that generated by water-based fracturing. Comparing to SC-CO2, L-CO2 and water, N2 has the least fracture-induced capacity (83\% of water) and produces more smooth and uniform fractures. On the other hand, the distributions of deviation angle suggest that fracture propagation is not only influenced by stress state, but also significantly affected by the original bedding plane. This experimental study proposes a precise and effective approach for fracture characteristic quantification, which can be further implemented into fracture simulation model. It also provides theoretical reference and guidance for field operation of waterless fracturing in development of unconventional oil and gas.},

	abstract = {The commercial production from tight oil and gas reservoirs has been facilitated by the multistage hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells. This process typically requires the pumping of large amounts of slick water into the subsurface, and this could be challenging in areas with a limited supply of water. Despite the commercial success of hydraulic fracturing with water, it still faces the problem of clay swelling and potential contamination of underground water. This has led to research studies and ﬁeld applications of liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) fracturing in unconventional oil and gas resources. Considering that the propagation and characteristics of these man-made fractures are controlled by the fracturing ﬂuid and mechanical state of the reservoir, we performed a series of fracturing experiments on tight sandstones using water and SC-CO2 at diﬀerent stress magnitudes. To explore the morphology of the fractures and quantify their attributes, we proposed a novel full-sample fracture analysis approach, which is based on microcomputed tomography (CT) imaging. The results of this study indicate that the breakdown pressure is a linear function of the minimum principal stress and tensile strength. We observe that the pattern and geometry of the fractures created from SC-CO2 fracturing is more complex than those of water fracturing under the same stress conditions. Our experimental results also indicate that smaller diﬀerential stresses lead to the creation of more fracture branches and that fracture propagation is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the presence of initial bedding planes. Furthermore, our quantiﬁcation of the fracture attributes (based on fracture extraction and digitization) indicates that SC-CO2 fracturing leads to the creation of more complex fractures with rougher surfaces than water fracturing. This experimental study proposes a new full-sample fracture quantiﬁcation approach, which can be implemented to analyze fracture attributes precisely and eﬀectively. The results from this work could provide insights and guidance for the ﬁeld application of SC-CO2 fracturing in unconventional oil and gas resources.},

	abstract = {The efficient solution of large sparse saddle point systems is very important in computational fluid mechanics. The discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods have become increasingly popular for incompressible flow problems but their application is limited due to high computational cost. We describe C++ programming techniques that may help to accelerate linear solvers for such problems. The approach is based on the policybased design pattern and partial template specialization, and is implemented in the open source AMGCL li­ brary. The efficiency is demonstrated with the example of accelerating an iterative solver of a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the Stokes problem. The implementation allows selecting algorithmic com­ ponents of the solver by adjusting template parameters without any changes to the codebase. It is possible to switch the system matrix to use small statically sized blocks to store the nonzero values, or use a mixed precision solution, which results in up to 4 times speedup, and reduces the memory footprint of the algorithm by about 40\%. We evaluate both monolithic and composite preconditioning strategies for 3 benchmark problems. The performance of the proposed solution is compared with a multithreaded direct Pardiso solver and a parallel iterative PETSc solver.},

	abstract = {Radial jet drilling (RJD) is an efficient approach for improving the productivity of wells in low permeability, marginal and coal-bed methane (CBM) reservoirs at a very low cost. It uses high-pressure water jet to drill lateral holes from a vertical wellbore. The length of the lateral holes is greatly influenced by the frictional resistance in the hole deflector. However, the hole deflector frictional resistance and structure design have not been well studied. This work fills that gap. Frictional resistances were measured in a full-scale experiment and calculated by numerical simulation. The structure of the hole deflector was parameterized and a geometric model was developed to design the hole deflector track. An empirical model was then established to predict the frictional resistance as a function of the hole deflector structure parameters and an optimization method for designing the hole deflector was proposed. Finally, four types of hole deflectors were optimized using this method. The results show good agreement between the numerical simulation and the experimental data. The model error is within 11.6\%. The bend radius R and exit angle β are the key factors affecting the performance of the hole deflector. The validation test was conducted for a case hole deflector (5½ in. casing). The measured frictional resistance was decreased from 31.44 N to 23.16 N by 26.34\%. The results from this research could serve as a reference for the design of hole deflectors for radial jet drilling.},
